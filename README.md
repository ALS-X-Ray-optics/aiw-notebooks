# aiw-notebooks
Bunch of notebooks from Antoine Islegen-Wojdyla useful for beamline calculations. Most of the notebooks shouldn't rely on packages, attempting to perform the calculations using scripts from scratch, in order to provide a finer understanding of what happens behind the hood.

It is recommended to do a copy of the notebook (with a different name) if you make modifications, to avoid losing something that works!
